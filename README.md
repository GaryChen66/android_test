## Assignment

For assignment instructions, see [ASSIGNMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](ASSIGNMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

The tasks you need to complete are outlined in the assignment instructions. We would like to see you do as much as you can, but you don't need to finish every one. We expect this test to take around **1 hour**, but please limit your submission to **2 hours**.

Please don't change app architecture or move components around. We suggest to make the minimal vital changes to the app.
We value your time and encourage to not spend time on refactoring the code.
Instead we expect you to provide your thoughts about what can be done better architecture wise. Please write your thoughts in `NOTES.md` file.

## Evaluation

We'll evaluate the code you submit based on the following criteria:

* Code quality
* Ability to meet the functional requirements
* Ability to match the given designs exactly
* Ability to find and fix UX issues 
* Content of your `NOTES.md` file

## Submission Process

When you are finished or the allotted time has elapsed, please send your completed project folder back to us as a zip file.

## Setup

Open the `build.gradle` and `NOTES.md` to get started!
